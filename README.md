The data for our project was retrieved from https://catalog.data.gov 
The specific data set is Crime Reports in the city of Austin, Texas https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-reports-bf2b7

  * Incident Number
  * Highest Offense Description
  * Occurred Date
  * Occurred Time
  * Report Date
  * Report Time
  * Location Type
  * Address
  * Zip Code
  * Census Tract
  * Clearance Date 
  * X-coordinate
  * Y-coodinate
  * Latitude
  * Longitude
  * Location (latitude and longitude) 
Next rows were deleted to only show the reportable crime data for the year 2021 in the city of Austin, Texas. After these filtering processes we had over 54000 records. The data was uploaded to Jupyter Notebook where null values were dropped. The shape of the remaining data is as follows:
